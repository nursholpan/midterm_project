					<h3>The Semipalatinsk Test Site, also known as "The Polygon"</h3>
					<p> It is located in Zhanasemey District, Abai Region, Kazakhstan, south of the valley of the Irtysh River. It was the primary testing venue for the Soviet Union's nuclear weapons. A total of 456 nuclear explosions were held at Semipalatinsk test site over four decades. The total explosive yield was 250 times the bomb that razed Hiroshima to the ground in 1945.</p>

					<h3>Radius of Affect</h3>
					<p>Approximately 1.6 million individuals living in the Semipalatinsk region, as well as in the neighboring districts of Pavlodar, East Kazakhstan, and Karaganda, are recognized as victims of nuclear tests conducted by the Soviet military-industrial complex between 1949 and 1989. Loud explosions, blinding flashes of light, and ominous mushroom clouds became a haunting norm for those living in Semey/Semipalatinsk. As a result, most residents of Semey were unaware that these nuclear tests were occurring, as they were not considered authorized personnel by the USSR. The justification for conducting tests in close proximity to civilian populations was based on false claims made by Soviet scientists, who asserted that there were no people within thousands of kilometers of the test sitesâ€”claims that were untrue. The devastating consequences of this negligence continue to affect the health of local residents and wildlife to this day. </p>

					<h3>The Consequences of Bombing</h3>
					<p>Studies have suggested that the impact of these tests was four times more severe than that of the infamous Chernobyl disaster, yet the tests in Semipalatinsk were conducted deliberately. Many residents believe that the site was intentionally chosen to observe the effects of radiation on humans. As a consequence, the region now has the highest rates of cancer, elevated mortality rates among young people, increased incidences of miscarriages, cases of Down syndrome, and births with deformities. Alarmingly, during the testing period, doctors were prohibited from linking these medical conditions to radiation exposure, and the broader world, including other parts of Kazakhstan, remained largely oblivious to these atrocities. </p>
