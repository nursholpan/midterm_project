				<p>The Semipalatinsk Testing Site, located in northeastern Kazakhstan, was established in 1947 by the Soviet Union. Known as the "Polygon," it became one of the world’s largest nuclear test sites.On August 29, 1949, the Soviet Union conducted its first nuclear test at Semipalatinsk. This marked the beginning of an intense period of testing as the USSR sought to catch up with the U.S. in nuclear capabilities.</p>

				<p>Between 1949 and 1963, the site witnessed 116 atmospheric nuclear explosions, releasing vast amounts of radioactive fallout. These tests significantly impacted the environment and human health in surrounding areas.</p>

				<p>After the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963, which prohibited atmospheric tests, the Soviet Union moved testing underground at Semipalatinsk. This continued until 1989, with over 300 additional nuclear detonations taking place underground.</p>

				<p>By the late 1980s, rising public awareness and protests against the harmful effects of radiation led by activist movements like "Nevada-Semipalatinsk" began to gain momentum. This marked a turning point in the site's history.On August 29, 1991, in a historic move, Kazakhstan’s President Nursultan Nazarbayev officially shut down the Semipalatinsk Testing Site, just months before the Soviet Union's collapse. This date is now commemorated as the International Day Against Nuclear Tests.The site left a lasting legacy of radiation exposure, impacting over 1.5 million people and contaminating vast areas. Even today, efforts to rehabilitate the land and monitor public health continue, highlighting the long-term consequences of nuclear testing.</p>
